# Crypto_systems_Research
In today's linked digital world, safe communication, data security, and privacy are crucially supported by the discipline of cryptography. Continuous research is essential to improve cryptographic methods, create reliable algorithms, and resolve possible weaknesses as technology develops and new threats appear.

so as a team we were thought to do a reaserach as a trial to our main reasearch project. In there we thought of doing some suggestions to the military grade encryption. 
Question: is it possible to combine both homomorphic and military grade encryption together so that without any decryption of ciphertext organizations can provide cipher text to the organizations. and the process will more easy and efficient.

after some studying about both areas we have finally come to an conclution that merging both AES and homomorphic encryption is not better solution. 
In our particular scenario, our team had first thought of combining AES and homomorphic encryption but then changed the study focus. Here, the focus has shifted to examining the distinctions between Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SHE) and the AES 256-bit standard due to factors such as a clearer and more well-defined research direction, a practical assessment, a comparative analysis, the allocation of resources, particularly time, the meeting of research objectives, application specifics, and so on.

NEXT STEP:
so we, as a team thought of changing the route of this research. so the question is, 
what are the differences in SHE: somewhat homomorphic encryption and AES 256bit standard.
